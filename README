Instructions on how to build Tor Browser Bundle deterministically with the NSS patch applied.
This will also build stcppipe deterministically.
NB: you must always be online during this process, because the VM pulls in dependencies 
NB: This will consume at least 85 GB of disk space

You can select all and copy-paste the commands below into bash (including the #comments)


#--------------------------BASH BEGIN--------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/themighty1/tlsnotary.git
git clone https://git.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git
git clone -b tor-browser-builder-3 https://git.torproject.org/builders/gitian-builder.git
cd tor-browser-bundle
#we checkout a specific commit (Mon Mar 17 16:03:29 2014) against which these instructions are written
git checkout e72925e055b78cb4a972dd6a8447baffd8aedf6e
cd gitian
#remove the word "torsocks " from line 59 - this will enable quicker downloads directly rather than via tor
sed -i '59s/torsocks //' Makefile
export USE_LXC=1
make prep
#be aware that early during the download stage, you will be prompted once to accept a certificate

#apply patches to NSS libs
cd ../../gitian-builder/inputs/tor-browser
#checkout commit from 2014-02-13 23:20:16. May take a while cause the repo is huge

#commit the changes to git, create a new tag. May take a couple of minutes cause the repo is huge

git tag -a tor-browser-24.3.0esr-3.5.2.1-build2_tlsnotary -m "tlsnotary tag"
cd ../../../tor-browser-bundle/gitian
#tell gitian to build our custom tag and ignore the fact that our tag is not signed by tor crew
sed -i '8s/3.5.2.1-build2/3.5.2.1-build2_tlsnotary/' versions
sed -i '46s/exit 1/#exit 1/' verify-tags.sh

make build
#--------------------------BASH END--------------------------------

NB: you will be asked to enter the password 4 times(at the interval of approx 30 mins)
for each VM built : lucid-x86, lucid-amd64, precise-x86, precise-amd64
