Auditor Usage Instructions
==========================

Using TLSNotary as an auditor requires a more serious investment of time and effort, clearly.
The first steps would be to read the other documentation, starting with the [README](https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsnotary/blob/master/README.md),
and going on from there. Understanding the cryptography in detail is not a requirement, but you should at least
familiarise yourself with the basics of the algorithm as laid out in the [algorithm whitepaper](TLSNotary.pdf).
To be a little clearer on this point, you don't need to understand the details of TLS 1.0, the PRF modifications 
or the RSA homomorphism.

It's also very important that, before you start using TLSNotary in a real audit situation, you become very familiar
with its filesystem layout. In particular, you'll need to get used to where audit records are stored and how to read
them. This is covered in some detail below.

##Preparatory steps

###Setting up IRC.
In the file `tlsnotary.ini` in the `data/shared` directory, there are three settings for IRC. We default to freenode,
the most widely used IRC server, on the standard port 6667. However, you *should* change the IRC channel to one that
you have created and registered. You need to register to enable voicing of new users. The correct steps can and will of course differ if you do not use freenode.

###Test out TLSNotary.
Once you have your IRC channel, and have recorded its name in `tlsnotary.ini`, you'll need to test it out. Run 
TLSNotary as an ordinary user and do self test for some random pages. Check that you see appropriate output in your
IRC channel; it should look like this:

except that the name of the channel is your chosen name. Notice that all traffic between users is encrypted.

Your next task is to review what data was generated by your tests. TLSNotary has two root folders containing audit data, they are:

`data/auditee/sessions` and `data/auditor/sessions`

Each `sessions` directory contains a subdirectory named with a timestamp for each audit run. You may need to set up some kind of administrative system to keep track of which timestamps correspond to which auditee that you deal with (although the data inside should rescue you if you get confused).

Inside the timestamped directory you should see something like this (when the audit is over):

We'll go through all these items one by one:

* **mypubkey, myprivkey,auditorpubkey** - copies of the public/private keypair that you used for this audit session.
* **auditeetrace.zip** - zip file sent by the auditee; it's unzipped in the folder above.
* **commit** - this folder contains the sha256 hashes and related data which the auditee sent to you to prove the content of the audit before you enabled him to decrypt it. You shouldn't need to use this except in very 'deep' debugging cases. If it is missing, the audit will *definitely* not be valid.
* **auditeetrace** - this folder contains the full version(s) of the encrypted traffic that the auditee "promised" (committed to) in the folder `commit`, in files `response1,2..`. The files `cs1`,`IV1` are cipher suite and initialisation vector, respectively, which are needed to enable decryption, and the `md5hmac` file is not really needed but included for legacy reasons (may be dropped later). The numbered suffices of these files (starting with 1 and increasing) refer to the html page being audited, in case more than one is involved (should be rare).
* **decrypted** - this is by far the most important directory. It contains two files - `domain1` and `html-1` (the numbers are as above). The html file is the file you intend to audit. The domain file represents the auditee's **claim** of what server he was accessing. More on this below.

In this initial testing phase, you need to check that the html you see in the `decrypted` folder corresponds with what you saw in the browser when you conducted the test. There is basically no circumstance where there will be a difference, but check anyway (since this is what you'll be doing in real audits). Note that this html was generated by doing standard SSL decryption of the binary data in the `response` file mentioned above.

In case any of the files or folders mentioned above are missing, you must assume that the audit is not valid. Check the console log for clues as to what might have gone wrong.

###Try out normal mode.

Once all of the above is clear and working properly, the next step is to run tests with auditor and auditee on different machines. The other machine can be a VM if that's more convenient, although there's something to be said for testing out the process with a remote friend, as it will mirror real life conditions more accurately.

The auditor should be started with the command:

`python data/auditor/tlsnotary-auditor.py`

after which you should see this: 

![](AuditorWindow.png)

You'll notice:

1. This script opens a tab in your existing Firefox window, if it's open, or starts that version of Firefox. Notice you don't have an extension here; there is no 'AUDIT THIS PAGE' button in the status bar.
2. You have two fields for auditor and auditee pubkey. These long character strings are base64 encoded RSA public keys (4096 bit). Key management is discussed in the next section.
3. You should press "Connect to auditee" **before** the auditee presses "Connect" on his side, so make sure to manage this and help the auditee through the process. You'll need to have some kind of real-time or semi-real time connection (chat, email etc.).
4. The auditee will then do his audit session in the way described in the main [User guide](https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsnotary/blob/master/README.md#user-guide). During this period you don't need to do anything but wait for the prompts in the window.
5. Once the audit has finished you should see indication of this in the Firefox tab. Here is an example of what you'll see:

![](AuditorFinished.jpg)

Notice the indication that decryption is successful. If it fails for any reason, you will get clear indication of it in the console window as well as on this screen. In that case, the audit, obviously, has failed, and you will have to try again or debug the problem.

Now that the audit session is finished, you can go to the indicated directory and check the decrypted html to conduct the 'human' part of the audit. In this, follow the instructions as above for [Test out TLSNotary](#test-out-tlsnotary).

###Key management.
Your TLSNotary public/private keypair is generated anew when you first start TLSNotary as auditor with the command:



, and is stored in the folder `data/auditor/recentkeys/myprivkey` and `mypubkey`. Although keys can be regenerated, it's simplest to keep a backup of these keys securely and never change them. It goes without saying that you should practice good OS hygiene to make sure these keys cannot be stolen; keeping yourself un-hacked is part of your role as auditor.

You will also see a file `auditeepubkey` kept in that folder; it's probably self-explanatory, but it's kept for ease of use in case of multiple audits with the same auditee. Whenever you open the auditor window, the "Auditee key" field will be automatically populated with this key; you can of course override, and always check that you have the right key before starting the audit.
