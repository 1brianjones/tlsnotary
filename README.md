tlsnotary allows the auditee to prove to the auditor that a certain https page is present in the auditee's browser.
This can be used e.g. when the auditee must prove to an arbitrator that a bank transfer has been made.

The original idea started here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173220.0
