###Really, really short version: ###

tlsnotary allows the auditee to prove to the auditor that a certain https page is present in the auditee's browser.
This can be used e.g. when the auditee must prove to an arbitrator that a bank transfer has been made.

##How to install and run##

Do stuff and install.

##User guide.##

Here's how to do it.

###For historical reference###

The original idea started here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173220.0 . Please note that the earliest discussions are about something very different (in terms of software architecture, if not intent) than modern-day TLSNotary.
